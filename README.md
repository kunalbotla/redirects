# redirects
redirects on kunalbotla.com; each one with a branch

the steps for use are below:
1. create a branch for the redirect
2. edit the index.html file of the branch with the applicable info as shown
3. create a site on netlify using the repo and branch
4. name the site on netlify
5. set one or more domains to the site so they can redirect to the page in the index.html

I made this for my own use so I do not know how well it would work for other's use case.
